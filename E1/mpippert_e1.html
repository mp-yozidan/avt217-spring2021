    <p>Madison Pippert</p>

    <!--Question 1-->
    <h4>Rae Higgins: What is a game you are currently playing or have recently finished? (you could list maybe your favorite game, could be an app game or any type of game!)</h4>
    <p>I have been playing a great deal of Dragalia Lost lately, as well as a collection of browser-based pet games.</p>

    <!--Question 2-->
    <h4>Cavin Loh: What is a big achievement that you achieved during quarantine or want to?</h4>
    <p>I finished a very detailed piece of marker artwork within the past few months.</p>

    <!--Question 3-->
    <h4>Camellia Au: Do you have good posture right now?</h4>

    <!--Question 4-->
    <h4>Lina Selhani: Do you often question if the amount of clothes you buy a month is reasonable?</h4>
    <p>Not at all. In fact, I hardly buy clothes for myself at all, and I've been planning on getting rid of some old ones in preparation for ordering some things I actually like.</p>

    <!--Question 5-->
    <h4>Robabeh Riasati: Which do you prefer if you like to eat meat: Hunting or Farming?</h4>
    <p>As far as I know, I have only ever eated farmed meat in my life. The sole exception to that is probably seafood. I'm really not sure if I have a preference since I have no frame of reference.</p>

    <!--Question 6-->
    <h4>Gaby Rojas: What's the happiest moment in your life?</h4>
    <p>You can't just ask me incredibly hard-hitting memory-based questions like this! The best answer I can give is at least one Christmas morning as a small child.</p>

    <!--Question 7-->
    <h4>Josiah Koehler: What is your favorite book series?</h4>
    <p>I don't read enough books to give a good answer. If I had to pick, it'd be a tossup between Animorphs and the Time Quintet.</p>

    <!--Question 8-->
    <h4>Shabreah "Breah" Woods: Did you drink water today and why not?</h4>
    <p>Of course I did! I'm easing into a new regimen of psych meds and friends with similar conditions recommended to me to drink as much water as I can. Still haven't been drinking enough, but I drank <i>something.</i></p>

    <!--Question 9-->
    <h4>Asiya Freeman: What’s your favorite cartoon character?</h4>
    <p>Bill Cipher is one of my all-time favorite TV villains.</p>

    <!--Question 10-->
    <h4>Michelle Diaz: Adidas or Nike?</h4>
    <p>The tennis shoes I've had over the years have typically been Nike.</p>

    <!--Question 11-->
    <h4>Sharon O'Boyle: If you could ask a question of anyone (living or dead), whom would you ask and what would the question be?</h4>
    <p>WOW that's a tough one. I'd love to talk to Einstein about spacetime warping though.</p>

    <!--Question 12-->
    <h4>Wes Anaya: Disregarding money as a factor, what would your dream job be?</h4>
    <p>Art freelancer and solo game dev!</p>

    <!--Question 13-->
    <h4>Miranda Galas: If you could change one thing from your culture, what would it be?</h4>
    <p>Evangelical conservatism. Of all the things middle class WASPs like me suck for, that's the one that hurts the people I care about the most.</p>

    <!--Question 14-->
    <h4>Noah Brennan: What do you do to unwind and cool down?</h4>
    <p>shoutouts to simpleflips</p>

    <!--Question 15-->
    <h4>Tiffany LeBlanc: Do you eat ketchup with your eggs?</h4>

    <!--Question 16-->
    <h4>Yuxuan Hu: Can you use an adjective or a sentence to describe what makes you different from other people？</h4>
    <p>I am not made unique by my individual facets, but by their combination.</p>

    <!--Question 17-->
    <h4>Maria Calvio: Whats a few things you have on your bucket list before moving on to the next life?</h4>
    <p>I want to visit Japan, try my hand at resin or epoxy crafts and jewelry, create a custom statue all the way from modeling to 3D printing, launch and manage a species of adoptable characters, and develop and release my two biggest personal video game concepts!</p>

    <!--Question 18-->
    <h4>Jordan Land: If you could be any animal, what would you be?</h4>
    <p>Probably a fox, though a few birds or sea creatures would be fun to experience too.</p>

    <!--Question 19-->
    <h4></h4>
    <p></p>

    <!--Question 20-->
    <h4>My Own Question: Have you ever created fan art, fanfiction, or remixed music from a piece of media you like?</h4>
    <p>All three! It's how I got into art, writing, and music in the first place. I asked this question because I wanted to see if anyone else did the same, what fandoms and franchises they created for, and their medium of choice.</p>
