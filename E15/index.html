    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Open Adobe XD.
        <ul>
          <li>If you do not have Adobe XD, open a digital art or design software available to you.</li>
          <li>The software should have the ability to draw basic shapes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Create a new file with the dimensions of 1000 by 1000 pixels.</li>
      <li>Make the artboard fill color pure white (hex code #FFFFFF).
        <ul>
          <li>If using an illustration software, use the bucket fill tool to make your lowermost layer #FFFFFF.</li>
          <li>All further instructions will be given for Adobe XD and similar programs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select the rectangle tool.</li>
      <li>Draw a square 500 by 500 pixels.</li>
      <li>Switch back to the arrow tool.</li>
      <li>Drag the square to the exact center of the artboard.</li>
      <li>In the sidebar, change the square's fill color to pure magenta (#FF00FF).</li>
      <li>In XD, there is a default border option. Make sure it's activated for the square. The border should be 1 pixel in width with a color of #707070.</li>
      <li>Select the ellipse tool.</li>
      <li>Draw a circle with the dimensions of 500 by 500 pixels.</li>
      <li>Switch back to the arrow tool.</li>
      <li>Place this circle in the top-right corner so that its edges align with the edges of the artboard.</li>
      <li>In the sidebar, change the circle's fill color to pure cyan (#00FFFF).</li>
      <li>Make sure the circle is in front of the magenta square.</li>
      <li>Make sure the circle has no border.</li>
      <li>Select the ellipse tool again.</li>
      <li>Draw a circle with the dimensions of 200 by 200 pixels.</li>
      <li>Switch back to the arrow tool.</li>
      <li>Drag this smaller circle on top of the bigger one and align it in the center of the larger circle.
        <ul>
          <li>If you're having trouble, the coordinates for this smaller circle in XD should be X=650 and Y=150.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Make sure the smaller circle is in front of the large one.</li>
      <li>In the sidebar, change the small circle's color to pure yellow (#FFFF00).</li>
      <li>Make sure the small circle has no border.</li>
      <li>Go to File > Export > All Artboards.</li>
      <li>Save the drawing as a PNG file to a folder of your choice.</li>
