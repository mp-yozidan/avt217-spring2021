    <h1>Exercise 4: Site Map</h1>

    <h3><a href="madisonpippert.weebly.com">Madison Pippert's Portfolio</a></h3>
    <p>This website was built via Weebly to host galleries of my artwork. It's targeted towards prospective employers in the creative industries, contract or otherwise, and is also designed to appeal to curious passerby with an easy-to-read template and well-categorized galleries.</p>

    <p>The primary action of the site is to deliver content by which to judge my skills. As a result, it is a static website, and all of its interactive elements are links to pages of my art or downloadable files.</p>
