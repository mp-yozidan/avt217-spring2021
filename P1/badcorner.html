    <p>Across the room from the corner, the walls come together at a set of unknowable
        angles, just a few degrees too narrow to be physically possible.</p>

    <p>The corner resents its opposite. You cannot know the shape of its companion,
      and for that reason the corner cannot know either. Your thoughts are not robust
      enough to teach it of its sibling's nature. For that, the corner may
      resent you, too.</p>
