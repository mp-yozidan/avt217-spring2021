    <p>The alluring call of the spiraling void, of enlightenment you couldn't
    possibly dream of predicting, draws you in. The corner could never hope to
    access this knowledge itself. It is but a gateway, doomed to forever be
    ignorant of the treasure it guards.</p>

    <p>As you enter the void and your consciousness slips away, you wonder for
    just a moment if the sublime knowledge of the universe was never there, and
    if the corner had merely deceived you into its soulsucking maw.</p>

    <p>You decide that it doesn't matter.</p>
