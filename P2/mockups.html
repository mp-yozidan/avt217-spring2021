    <h1>Project 2 Design Drafts</h1>
    <h3>Iteration: P2.5</h3>

    <h5>Notes</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Pink text represents hyperlinks.</li>
      <li>An exception to the above is the header navigation.</li>
      <li>Previous iterations of the final 320 draft, "linksmenu320.png", appeared gray in previous submissions due to a lower opacity. It was intended that the links menu would slide out from a side of the window when the eye icon is clicked, while the current page would be just barely visible underneath. I've altered the opacity to 100% for better accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
