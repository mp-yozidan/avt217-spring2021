    <h1>Project 2 Design Drafts</h1>
    <h3>Iteration: P2.6</h3>

    <h5>Notes</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Pink text represents hyperlinks.</li>
      <li>An exception to the above is the header navigation.</li>
      <li>Previous iterations of the final 320 draft, "linksmenu320.png", appeared gray in previous submissions due to a lower opacity. It was intended that the links menu would slide out from a side of the window when the eye icon is clicked, while the current page would be just barely visible underneath. I've altered the opacity to 100% for better accuracy.</li>
      <li>Album covers under "Latest Releases" are meant to be clickable images. Album title hover effects were not initially envisioned, nor was an image gallery. I felt the single album more appropriate for the mobile version. I've added a little "See More" link below the albums, but I haven't turned it into a gallery to preserve my initial vision. Unfortunately, I'm not entirely sure how to change the text content of a page with a media query, so I left "Latest Releases" unchanged even if switching to singular would be more appropriate for the 320 design.</li>
      <li>The awkward use of only the three center columns was designed with the expectation that 1440 is oversized for a monitor. My own monitor is smaller than 1440 so I designed the initial drafts of the 1440 pages to crop comfortably to 1280px. I have adjusted the 1440 designs to take full advantage of my columns in the final draft as suggested, since a real project would probably just have me design an additional mockup for a new media query.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thanks for teaching this class, Michael! I had an absolute blast learning the material. I'm going to continue building my web development skills outside of school.</p>
